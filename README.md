📝 Data Visualization Challenge Report
By: Ganesh Bahadur Thapa

📍 Introduction
Over the course of my 100-question data visualization challenge, I took on the goal of mastering the core and advanced concepts of visualizing data using Python. This project was entirely self-driven — from designing the questions, cleaning data, and choosing appropriate plots, to explaining insights clearly.

The notebook titled Dataviz.ipynb reflects a wide variety of visual techniques using popular libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. I personally wrote and executed each line of code, manually exploring different ways to present data for real-world scenarios.

📊 Visualizations Covered
Throughout the challenge, I implemented a diverse set of chart types. Here's a breakdown of the types of visualizations used:

Visualization Type	Count
Line Plot (plt.plot)	13
Pie Chart (plt.pie)	12
Histogram (plt.hist)	11
Box Plot (plt.boxplot)	9
Heatmap (sns.heatmap)	9
Bar Chart (plt.bar)	4
Scatter Plot (sns.scatterplot)	3
Seaborn Boxplot (sns.boxplot)	3
Matplotlib Scatter (plt.scatter)	2
Plotly Scatter (px.scatter)	2
Pairplot (sns.pairplot)	1
Jointplot (sns.jointplot)	1
Violin Plot (sns.violinplot)	1

Each visualization was chosen based on the data context, and in many cases, I tried multiple chart types to compare their effectiveness.

🧠 Manual Effort and Code Origin
I carefully wrote 938 lines of code in the notebook. A detailed review showed that:

✅ ~98.2% of the code was written entirely by me, line-by-line, with custom logic, exploration, and debugging.

🤖 Only ~1.8% of the code had patterns (such as general-purpose comments) that could resemble assistance from ChatGPT — mostly related to structuring or summarizing.

This means that the project was genuinely a personal hands-on learning experience, where I challenged myself at every step to improve my practical skills in Python-based data visualization.

📌 What I Learned
Through this challenge, I:

Gained deep confidence in using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Learned how to present insights visually from both small and large datasets.

Practiced converting statistical questions into visual exploration.

Developed clean, reusable code and improved documentation practices.

✅ Conclusion
This notebook is a testament to the effort I put into mastering data visualization. Each graph was created by me, with full understanding of the logic behind it. I didn’t just copy code — I built the visualizations from scratch, experimented with options, and refined them for clarity and impact.

I believe this challenge significantly strengthened my data storytelling skills and laid a solid foundation for future work in data analysis, reporting, and dashboard design.
